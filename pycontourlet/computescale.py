    COMPUTESCALE   Comupute display scale for PDFB coefficients

    Input:

    subband_dfb:
        A multidimentional list, one for each layer of subband images from DFB.
    Each subband is represented as a numpy array
    ratio:
    Display ratio. It ranges from 1.2 to 10.

    start:
    Starting index of the cell vector subband_dfb for the computation.
    Its default value is 1.

    end:
    Ending index of the cell vector subband_dfb for the computation.
    Its default value is the length of subband_dfb.

    mode:
    coefficients mode (a string):
    'real' ----  Highpass filters use the real coefficients.
    'abs' ------ Highpass filters use the absolute coefficients.
    It's the default value
    Output:
    Scales ----- 1 X 2 list for two scales.
